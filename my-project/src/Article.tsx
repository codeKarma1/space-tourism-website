        The Problems We Face in Nigeria and the Struggles of Students
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Nigeria is a country filled with potential, yet many challenges hold it
        back from reaching its full greatness. Issues such as corruption, poor
        infrastructure, insecurity, unemployment, and lack of stable electricity
        affect the lives of millions of citizens on a daily basis.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        As students, these problems are not just distant issuesâ€”we feel them
        directly. The cost of education is rising, while facilities in many
        schools remain inadequate. Constant strikes, poor funding of
        universities, and lack of access to modern learning resources make it
        harder for young people to build a bright future.

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Beyond academics, students also face the economic hardship of the
        country. Inflation makes textbooks, food, and even transport more
        expensive, while job opportunities after graduation are uncertain. This
        creates frustration and pressure, forcing many to seek opportunities
        abroad.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Yet, despite all these problems, Nigerian students continue to show
        resilience and creativity. From tech to entrepreneurship, many young
        people are pushing through the difficulties and finding ways to succeed
        against the odds.

        Conclusion
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The problems in Nigeria are real and affect every part of our lives.
        Students, as the future leaders, are caught in the middle of these
        struggles. But with determination and the right opportunities, we can
        become part of the solution and create a brighter tomorrow.
